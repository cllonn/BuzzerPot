Recommendations for the SC8002B:
1. Power Supply
Recommended Voltage: 2.0V - 5.5V (Typically 5V)
Current Consumption: ≥500mA
Max Output Power: 2W at 5V with 4Ω Load
Decoupling Capacitor: A 100µF capacitor is recommended on the power supply line to stabilize the voltage and prevent noise.

2. Speaker Impedance
The SC8002B supports 4Ω or 8Ω speakers.
For a 4Ω speaker: It can output 2W at 5V.
For an 8Ω speaker: It can output 1.5W at 5V.
Ensure the speaker impedance matches the amplifier to prevent overheating or distortion.

3. Input Coupling Capacitor
The amplifier requires an input capacitor (usually 0.1µF - 1µF) to block DC voltage and allow AC (audio) signals to pass through.

4. Volume Control (Potentiometer)
Recommended 10kΩ potentiometer for volume adjustment (which you are using).
The potentiometer should be placed at the input signal line before the amplifier.

5. Output Capacitor & Load Configuration
If using Single-Ended (SE) mode, you need a large output capacitor (~220µF) to block DC and pass audio.
If using Bridge-Tied Load (BTL) mode, no capacitor is needed because both speaker terminals receive opposite-phase signals.

6. PCB Layout Recommendations
Keep power and ground traces thick to handle current demand.
Place decoupling capacitors close to the amplifier’s power pins to reduce noise.
Keep input signal traces away from power traces to prevent interference.


Ensure you add the required capacitors (input capacitor, decoupling capacitor, and possibly an output capacitor if using SE mode
