# Speaker PCB Project  
A PCB designed to drive a speaker using an SC8002B amplifier

## Project Overview  
This project is built for easy access to amplified sound output, designed using an SC8002B amplifier and a potentiometer to adjust volume. It operates within a 3.3V to 5V range for flexibility with different power sources.

## Features  
- SC8002B Audio Amplifier – Provides 1.2W output at 8Ω for clear sound.  
- Speaker Compatibility – Works with an 8Ω, 1W speaker (INGHAi GSPK2307P-8R1W).  
- Potentiometer Control – Uses a 3386P Long Neck with a knob for easy volume adjustment.  
- Compact PCB Layout – Optimized for space efficiency while maintaining performance.

## Usage  
To use the board:  
1- Connect Power – Attach a power source (3.3V - 5V)
2- Adjust Volume – Use the potentiometer to control the speaker output 
3- Apply an Audio Signal – Feed a signal from a microcontroller or an external sourc
4- Test Output Levels – Verify speaker performance at different power levels
